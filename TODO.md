# TODO — Reconstructed zhinst SeqC Compiler

> **All historical phases archived.**  Reconstruction has reached a
> steady state with no open work items as of 2026-05-08.

## Current state

**Build**: clean (g++ + clang++/libc++), 0 errors, 1 documented warning.
**Differential tests: 2407/2407 byte-identical** across all 10 unique
leaf manifests:

| Manifest                     | Cases |
| ---------------------------- | -----:|
| default `manifest.json`      | 1600 |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;`manifest-core.json`          | 248 |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;`manifest-zhinst.json`        |  74 |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;`manifest-ziai.json`          | 459 |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;`manifest-ziasm.json`         | 468 |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;`manifest-zivibes.json`       | 259 |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;`manifest-documentation.json` |  92 |
| `manifest-stress.json` (standalone) | 774 |
| `manifest-labone.json` (standalone) |  14 |
| `manifest-large.json` (standalone)  |  13 |
| `manifest-errors.json` (standalone) |   6 |
| **Total unique**             | **2407** |

Standalone manifests are not auto-imported by `manifest.json` and must
be invoked explicitly via `--manifest <name>.json`.

## Open work items

**None tracked here.**  Future findings will land here as new phases.

The only open finding is the cosmetic `IF-200` (`rand` deprecation
warning) — **fixed** as of commit `99f19ef` on 2026-05-08; tracked in
`reconstructed/notes/incidental_findings.md`.

## Commit conventions

- Per AGENTS.md: commit after every sub-phase wrap-up; include the
  test score in the commit message body; do not commit mid-debug.
- New work that opens its own phase should be added under
  `## Open work items` above with a `Phase NN: <title>` heading and
  a checklist; archive when complete.
